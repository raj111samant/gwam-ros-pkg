= Guardian-WAM Tutorial: Understanding the Guardian-WAM Nodes/Services/Topics=

*The following tutorial will help us better understand the Guardian-WAM Nodes, Services, and Topics on the ROS Graph.*

*Please bring up the entire Guardian-WAM System before continuing with this tutorial*

 - Turn on the Guardian & WAM power, starting the Guardian PC, and resetting the power to the motor controller.

 - Once the Guardian system is online, please SSH into the WAM PC and launch the wam_node

{{{
ssh robot@WAM
#password: WAM

roslaunch wam_bringup wam_guardian.launch
}}}

Your system should now be initialized and running, please continue with the tutorial.

== Guardian-WAM Nodes ==

ROS Nodes are the processes that perform computation.  As seen in the previous [http://code.google.com/p/gwam-ros-pkg/wiki/GWAMTutorialsNodeBlockDiagram tutorial] a number of nodes are launched on the Guardian-WAM Startup.  We also start the wam_node on ROS graph by logging into the WAM and launching it.  

To view all of the active guardian-wam nodes:
{{{
#First verify that your ROS_MASTER_URI is set to the guardian-wam
env | grep ROS_MASTER_URI

#if your ROS_MASTER_URI does not point to http://guardian-wam:11311
export ROS_MASTER_URI = http://guardian-wam:11311
#or edit your ROS Environment file (usually ~/ros/gwam_env.ros) to point to the guardian-wam pc

#The following displays all of the ROS nodes that are currently running on the Guardian-WAM

rosnode list
}}}

Most of these nodes should look familiar as they describe components of the Guardian-WAM system.

Future ROS nodes that a user may write will be displayed with the above command.
