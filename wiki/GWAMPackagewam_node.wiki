*The wam_node is the primary communication node between the WAM / !BarrettHand and ROS.*

The wam_node was designed to abstract the Libbarrett functionality exposed by the [http://code.google.com/p/gwam-ros-pkg/wiki/GWAMPackagelibbarrett_ros libbarrett_ros package] into a simple, fully functional ROS node.  Allowing for both real-time and non real-time control of the Barrett WAM.

The wam_node package is self aware of robot configuration.  This means that if you have a 7-dof WAM configuration but want to use the robot without the !BarrettHand the wam_node will take care of this.  Not publishing or subscribing to the services and messages available for a WAM with a !BarrettHand.

== __Interaction with the WAM / !BarrettHand__ == 

=== The WAM Node Publishes the following topics (default: 100Hz) ===

wam/joint_states - Publishes the current angle in radians for each joint present on the wam.

wam/pose - Publishes the current pose (cartesian position and orientation).

bhand/joint_states - Publishes the current angle in radians for each joint of the !BarrettHand.

=== The WAM Node Subscribes to the following topics - primarily for RT Control (up to 500Hz) ===

wam/rt_joint_pos _- type wam_msgs/RTJointPos_

wam/rt_joint_vel _- type wam_msgs/RTJointVel_

wam/rt_cart_pos _- type wam_msgs/RTCartPos_

wam/rt_cart_vel _- type wam_msgs/RTCartVel_

wam/rt_ortn_pos _- type wam_msgs/RTOrtnPos_

(TBD) wam/rt_ortn_vel _- type wam_msgs/RTOrtnVel_
