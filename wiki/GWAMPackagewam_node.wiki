*The wam_node is the primary communication node between the WAM / Barrett Hand and the ROS network.*

The wam_node was designed to abstract the Libbarrett functionality exposed by the [http://code.google.com/p/gwam-ros-pkg/wiki/GWAMPackagelibbarrett_ros libbarrett_ros package] into a simple, fully functional ROS node, allowing for both real-time and non real-time control of the Barrett WAM.
