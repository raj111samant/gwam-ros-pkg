The Guardian-WAM software framework is ROS (Robot Operating System).  For more information on ROS please visit [http://www.ros.org ros.org].

There are two primary communication techniques with the Guardian WAM:

=== Local PC Communication === 
*_The following is the preferred GWAM communication protocol._*

*Install ROS Electric:*

To use the Guardian-WAM in conjunction with a local pc, you must have installed a local copy of ROS Electric.  Installation instructions are available here: [http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/Ubuntu ROS Electric Installation].

*Configure ROS Network Setup:*  (_On your personal computer only!_)

You need to edit your */etc/hosts* file with sudo permissions and add the following lines
{{{
192.168.2.100   guardian-WAM
192.168.2.110   WAM
}}}

*Edit your local .bashrc:*

Add the following to your local *~/.bashrc* file with preferred text editor.  This will allow us to create a local environment description file for easy editing.
{{{
source ~/.gwambashrc.ros
}}}

Now that we have created the link to our local environment file, we must create it in our favorite text editor.

Create the file ~/.gwambashrc.ros and paste in the following
{{{
source /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash
alias gwam_sim='export ROBOT=sim; export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311;'
alias gwam_real='source ~/gwam_real_environment.sh'

#Uncomment and fill in accordingly the point to your ros packages
#export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/path_to_your_ros_packages:${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}

#Give the environment a default configuration (either gwam_sim or gwam_real).
gwam_sim
}}}

Now that we have created our local environment file, we must create the automatic script for loading your ip and rosmaster.  Download this shell script with the following commands:
{{{
cd ~/
wget http://gwam-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/files/gwam_real_environment.sh
}}}

In the last script we have exposed two commands to you.  You can now use the command line in any terminal and set up your environment variables very easily.  

In a new terminal you should now be able to give either command:

{{{
gwam_sim
## or ##
gwam_real
}}}

These commands will automatically set up your environment to reflect if you would like to use the gwam robot or simulation accordingly.

Please test the commands in a new terminal to verify completeness.

A handy command to view your ROS Environment variables at any time is:
{{{
env | grep ROS
}}}



=== Secure Shell Guardian PC Communication === 

Another alternative for controlling the Guardian-WAM is using the onboard PC of the Guardian as the working machine.  

Although this is not suggested it is an alternative for those who do not want to install ROS on a local machine.

This is done by connecting the local PC to a network and accessing the Guardian PC remotely using a secure shell (ssh) client or remote terminal software.

*_Linux_*

You need to edit your */etc/hosts* file with sudo permissions and add the following lines
{{{
192.168.2.100   guardian-WAM
192.168.2.110   WAM
}}}

In a new terminal, log into the Guardian PC using secure shell client software, ex.:
{{{
ssh guardian@guardian-WAM
#username: guardian
#password: GUARDIAN
}}}

Using the secure shell client you now have all the ability to control the Guardian-WAM using ROS.

It is suggested that for any programs you create are located in the
~/ros workspace that is already configured on the Guardian PC.

If for any reason you need to log into the WAM PC (PC-104):
{{{
ssh robot@WAM
#username: robot
#password: WAM
}}}

All of the WAM ROS Software is located in the ~/ros workspace.  Please do not edit anything in the ~/ros/electric folder.



Now that you have finished setting up and communicating with your Guardian-WAM please continue to: [http://code.google.com/p/gwam-ros-pkg/wiki/GWAMROSInstallation gwam-ros-pkg Repository Installation Instructions.]
